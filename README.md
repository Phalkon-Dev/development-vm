## Installing and configuring Virtual Machine

### Why use Oracle VM VirtualBox?

Oracle VirtualBox is a popular choice for virtualization for several reasons:

**Cost:** VirtualBox is free and open-source, making it accessible to anyone without the need for licensing fees. In contrast, many other virtualization providers require payment for full features.

**Clipboard and Drag-and-Drop Support:** VirtualBox supports seamless clipboard sharing and drag-and-drop functionality between the host and guest operating systems. This feature allows for easy transfer of text and files without additional configuration or costs, which may not be available in some other free or paid virtualization solutions.

**Ease of Use:** While some open-source virtualization options can be complicated to install and configure on Windows, VirtualBox offers a straightforward installation process and user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to get started quickly.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** VirtualBox works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), allowing users to run different guest OS types without compatibility issues.

**Active Community and Support:** Being widely used, VirtualBox has a large community that provides support, documentation, and tutorials, making troubleshooting easier for users.

Overall, VirtualBox combines affordability, ease of use, and essential features, making it a strong choice for virtualization, especially for users who need clipboard and drag-and-drop functionality without additional costs.
